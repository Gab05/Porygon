## Porygon
Porygon is a command-line PokemonShowdown websocket client.

This project was meant to refactor a legacy project,
[Pokemon-Showdown-Bot](https://github.com/TalkTakesTime/Pokemon-Showdown-Bot)

This project is a work in progress. The code from the old project
is being rewritten in Typescript and refactored for lisibility.

Credits goes to the owner of the legacy project,
[TalkTakesTime](https://github.com/TalkTakesTime)
and other contributors.
